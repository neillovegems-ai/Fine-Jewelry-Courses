**Total: 159 articles (130 original catalog + 13 in C16 + 16 in C17). C1 is fully complete; C2 is complete (10/10 modules, published to Jewelswell LMS); C16 complete (13/13 modules, 65 production artifacts), independently built and verified per `courses/C16-gia-diamonds-deep-dive/production/VERIFICATION-REVIEW.md`. C17 complete (16/16 modules, 96 production artifacts, 160 quiz questions), independently built and verified per `courses/C17-gia-colored-stones-deep-dive/production/VERIFICATION-REVIEW.md`.**

**Note on C16:** independent study companion, not a GIA product, built from GIA's own "For Further Reading for Diamonds and Diamond Grading" bibliography (~260 *Gems & Gemology* / GIA Research citations). It adds a `references/` folder (full annotated bibliography) and a `videos/` folder (verified video index) to the standard layout. See its README for the module-to-assignment map and wave log, and `production/VERIFICATION-REVIEW.md` for the post-build fact-check review.

**Note on C17:** independent study companion, not a GIA product, built on the same model as C16 from GIA's "For Further Reading: Colored Stones" bibliography (~260 *Gems & Gemology* / GIA Research citations spanning ruby, sapphire, emerald, pearl and jade). Same repository layout (articles/ + production/ + references/annotated-bibliography.md + videos/video-library.md). See its README for the module-to-assignment map and wave log.

## Production rules (six-step SOP)

Every article is produced one at a time, with a full review/revision cycle between each, not batched:
1. **Review the draft** - 8-part structure, tone, sourcing check, VERIFY flags resolved against research.
2. **Self-critique and revise** - scored 1-5 against outcome alignment, factual discipline, floor readiness, voice, scannability, persona fit, and length; revised version with a change log.
3. **Fact-check extraction** - every checkable claim tabled with type, source, and risk; MUST VERIFY items flagged.
4. **Media handling** - real expert-produced media only (GIA, AGS, NDC, trade press, museums, credentialed channels), verified before use; no AI-generated imagery.
5. **Repurposing** - a one-page huddle card and a 10-question quiz per article (omitted only for modules that are themselves an assessment, e.g. capstones).
6. **Move to the next module** - only after the above are complete.

Word length is need-driven, not capped: articles may run well past the original 2,000-2,500 word guide, up to roughly 10,000 words, whenever the added depth genuinely helps the learner.
